## View the website
View the final product **[here](https://nathan-anderson-1024.github.io/fotomatic/)**

The idea for this project comes from CodeCademy where I was given a moqup of the final site and told to recreate it on my own.

The website is responsive to all device widths and some elements such as the nav bar change depending on your device.
